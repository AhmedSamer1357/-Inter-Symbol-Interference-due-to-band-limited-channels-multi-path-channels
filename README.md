# -Inter-Symbol-Interference-due-to-band-limited-channels-multi-path-channels
In part 1 , We will investigate another common channel in digital communication systems, which is the band-limited channel. As the name suggests, the channel only allows a limited range of frequency components to pass, while blocking frequency components outside this range. We investigate the simplest of such channels: a channel that has a flat response in the allowable range. In part 2, we consider another form of ISI that happens in channels that we face in wireless communication systems. The channel considered here is referred to as the multipath channel. To understand the effect of this channel
